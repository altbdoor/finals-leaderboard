# finals-leaderboard

_Because the original leaderboard was loading a 10,000 entry JSON file, and doing everything client side._

Made with:

- [React with Vite](https://react.dev/)
- [SQLite WASM](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite-wasm)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Chequered flag from twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/)

And also thanks to [leonlarsson/the-finals-leaderboard](https://github.com/leonlarsson/the-finals-leaderboard).
